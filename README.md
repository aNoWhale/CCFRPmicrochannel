well, you can see many .gcode files in the repo. Some of them are used in the paper and some are not.
main_function_0_90_v3Class.py is the main script to generate G code. 
Basiclly, you can understand how to use the script to generate your G code easily by imitating my code.
So, install the requirements.txt and run the main_function_0_90_v3Class.py!
It can work at python=3.10. (maybe also in python=3.9, I didn't try)
this is not a formal README, I will change it someday.
